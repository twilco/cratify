# Cratify

Want to know when another crate depends on yours?  We can notify (_cratify!_) you when this happens.

## How does it work?

* Sign up to receive cratifications for any crate.
* We monitor the [Cargo index](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index) for changes - when we see something you care about, we let you know via e-mail.
* And that's it!

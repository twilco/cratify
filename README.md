# Cratify 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twilco/cratify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twilco/cratify)

Want to know when another crate depends on yours?  We can notify (_cratify!_) you when this happens.

## How does it work?

* Sign up to receive cratifications for any crate (and optionally, a specific version of that crate).
* We monitor the [Cargo index](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index) for changes - when we see something you care about, we let you know via e-mail.
* And that's it!
